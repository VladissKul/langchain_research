The key to implementing the Pomodoro method is to set clear goals and deadlines, as well as to establish a routine schedule that works for you.\\n\\nYou can start by choosing a task or project that requires focus and attention. Next, set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the task without any distractions during this time.
